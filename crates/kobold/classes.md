# Nature and Nurture

In ______ two main factors shape who your character becomes: *Soul* and *Training*. *Soul* is something your character is born with, it shapes their personality to large degree, it's a source of their power and will to strive. Training on the other hand is a producing of circumstance, it reflects the upbringing of your character prior to embarking on the path of an adventurer. Have you trained with weapons as a soldier or a nobleman? Was your focus the pursuit of knowledge? Did you grow up on the streets or in the wilderness, having to fend for yourself?

# Soul

+ *Disciplined* - your mind is focused and determined, and your body is a reflection of it. You believe that hard work is the best way to get results, and that attitude shapes your entire existence. You don't do things half way, you don't set a plan B for yourself, whatever goal you set for yourself you will achieve, and whatever skill you choose to learn, you want to master.
+ *Devout* - you were put on Erda by a higher power and have a purpose to fulfill, that much you've always known to be true. You are passionate, you never break your word, and always act according to what you think is best, regardless of what other people might think. In moments of need, you seem to be able to perform extraordinary feats, causing awe or terror in those who doubt you.
+ *Awakened* - you are aware of reality beyond the grasp of ordinary people. By some cosmic accident you are able to glimpse into the Ethereal plane, and manifest fragments of it into the material plane.
